fearproblem1=You have to do a presentation in school. You are very scared of it. What do you do?
fear1_wrong1=Before my turn I laugh at others, especially if they seem nervous. It lessens my own anxiety.
fear1_wrong2=Better just skip the whole thing, there's no point in forcing myself to anything.
fear1_correct=I'll do the presentation anyway! Everyone's nervous about these things, besides I'll get stronger like this!
fearproblem2=You saw a real cool clothing item at store the other day, but you are worried if your friends would laugh at you for wearing it.
fear2_wrong1=I won't buy it. It's better to wear same clothes my friends do.
fear2_wrong2=I'll buy it, but I just wont wear it when my friends are around. That way I can still enjoy it.
fear2_correct=I'll buy it and wear it. How I dress is my business and besides true friends wouldn't mock me about it.
fearproblem3=You are under constant name-calling in school. How do you react to it?
fear3_wrong1=You let it happen, and just feel sad about it by yourself.
fear3_wrong2=You return the name-calling by letting the bully taste their own medicine. They deserve every word you got to say, after all.
fear3_correct=You seek help from a teacher or your parents. You can also try and think the name-calling to be strenghtening. The bully is only trying to inflate their own ego.

sorrow1_correct=I'll talk to someone about how I feel as soon as possible.
sorrowproblem2=Your exam at school went really bad and you feel like you're not good at anything else either. How do you cope?
sorrow2_wrong1=It's just the way I am. I'm not good at anything and that's it. I can't do anything about it.
sorrow2_wrong2=I'll need to be more tough with myself from now on. If I can't do better, I'm a bad person.
sorrow2_correct=I'll try to remember that actually I am good at some things and you know what, I'll do better next time. It's not the end of the world.
sorrowproblem3=You had an argument with your best friend and now you both stay muted to each other. You do still want your friend back.
sorrow3_wrong1=You still stay mute to your friend. The fight was their fault, and they didn't listen to what I had to say.
sorrow3_wrong2=You go and talk to your friend. You bring up the argument you had. You let your friend know how annoyed you were and how they were wrong about the subject.
sorrow3_correct=You go and tell your friend that you are sorry about your part of what happened. Try to understand their view of the matter. You don't lose a friend to one mistake.
hateproblem1=It's just one of those days. Everything pisses you off. How do you cope with it?
hate1_wrong1=The anger must be directed outside. I'll break something, or pick a fight.
hate1_wrong2=The anger must be directed inwards. I'll just be quiet and harbor my thoughts.
hate1_correct=I'll try to direct my anger into something constructive or creative. I could do some sports, or write about my feelings.
hateproblem2=You play basketball with your friend. He wins every game, and doesn’t even give a chance to win. You get really angry about it. What will you do?
hate2_wrong1=I get angry and I don't talk to him anymore.
hate2_wrong2=I try to take revenge on him sometimes.
hate2_correct=This is just a game. I ask my friends to teach me to play better.
hateproblem3=People talk about you behind your back and spread rumors that aren't true.
hate3_wrong1=You do nothing about the situation, even though it gives you anxiety. You hope that the talk about you ends soon.
hate3_wrong2=You start spreading rumors and talking bad about people you don't like, to make you feel better.
hate3_correct=You find out where this gossip originates from, and ask the people behind it to stop.
