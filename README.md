## About the Project:

Tower of Life is a fun tower stacking game for Android devices coded by TAMK students Artem Tolpa, Seppo Hyv√§rinen and Lari Kettunen.
The game is a part of "Empathizing way to build social inclusion" project with the purpose of teaching emotional skills 
to young people in the risk of inclusion. This educational aspect of the game is implemented in the in-game minigame that 
has various questions the player need to solve in order to proceed. The game supports 2 languages - English and Finnish.
The game is available FOR FREE in Google Play store:

For all of us coding this game was a fun and an educational experience, we hope you enjoy it as well!

## Language & Framework:

The game is coded in Java. It utilizes the libGDX framework and Box2d physics engine. The IDE used was Android Studio.

## How to play the game:

Playing the game is simple, the player taps the screen when box hanging in the top is wanted to be dropped. There are different boxes in the
game that represent different positive and negative emotions. The basic idea is simply to stack the boxes on top of each other, but there are challenges since
the different emotion boxes have different attributes (for example "Joy" boxes are more bouncy and so they are more difficult to stack).
If negative box is stacked, it will trigger a minigame. In the minigame the player is presented with a question that needs to be answered.
If the answer is correct (is a healthy way to react to the said question/problem) then score is added/multiplied and also the tower is stabilized by
"freezing" the blocks. If the answer is wrong (unhealthy way to react) then score multiplier is lost and the tower is not stabilized.

The game also has a built-in Highscore system.
